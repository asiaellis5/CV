## Asia Ellis

I am an enthusiastic and ambitious Full Stack Junior Developer with a passion for problem solving and building and creating exciting new things. I have recently graduated from the intesive Software Developement Bootcamp Makers Academy and I am look for a role where I can consolidate my programming knowledge, further my passion for this subject and work as part of a developer team to create exciting new things. My time at Makers not only taught me how to learn but has given me a deep understanding of the core skills of Software Development and has instilled in me great Agile processes whilst working as part of a team, which I am keen to put into practice.

## Skills

#### Teamwork and communication

- Learning from my experience in high level team sport and customer facing roles, I was able to work very effectively througout the makers process both pairing and in group work. There was a joke amongst my peers that I was the common denomenator in the most successful projects as well as ensuring support and always boosting morale. Learning from my role as Social Secretary for the hockey club at University, I organised many social events for all of my cohort to unwind. I was also a mentor for two students from the cohort below me and was on hand to offer advice and help with any problems they may have had.  

#### Attention to Detail

- For two years in a row I was given an internship at one of the largest Institutional Research Platforms in Europe. My role included researching, adding data to databases and proof reading final reports. This taught me the importance of agility with data and accuracy.   

#### Adaptable and Inquisitive

- I am not afraid to learn and try new things, to further my language skills I went to live in France where I was able to learn to speak French to University standard in just two months. My Ancient History degree taught me discipline and hard work pays off and drove me to crave a deep understanding of a subject. I have enjoyed applying these skills into software development, most recently in my final project where I was able to learn and use Python and Django in just two weeks.
